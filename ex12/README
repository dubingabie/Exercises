Greetings! we made a boggle game consisting of 3 windows:
-the start screen:
 a small window with stylish play button and some text with the name of the game
-the game screen:
this screen contains the 4 x 4 board on a button grid, a clear button that clears the buttons board
(returns all of the pressed to the regular color)
and the display and a choose button that checks if the word in the path and the path is legal.
the buttons in the board function in the following way:
    if a player presses an unpressed button it is colored in purple:
        if the button can be added to the current path it stays purple and if not it goes back to the regular color.
    if a player presses a button that is lit up in purple:
        the button goes back to the regular color if it is the last button that was pressed
        else it stays purple.
we also added a bank of the words that were already guessed using the tkinter list box,
if the player guesses a word that was already guessed the background of the list box turns purple for a few milliseconds
the game screen also contains a timer that displays the remaining round time
and it also shows the player's current score.
-the end game screen:
    this screen displays the players final score at the end of the round,
    the words that the player guessed during the round and finally a stylized play again button.
    if the play again button is pressed the player is taken to the game screen and begins a new round.

Notes:
* in our game we chose to stick to a purple-gray color scheme:
 firstly because gray is easy on the eyes and secondly because purple contrasts well with it.
